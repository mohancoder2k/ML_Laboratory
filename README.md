# Machine Learning Laboratory – Full Stack Implementations

This repository contains **real-time, full stack implementations** of selected Machine Learning laboratory programs.

Instead of submitting traditional standalone Python scripts, the lab experiments were **converted into working application-based prototypes**, demonstrating how ML models are used in real-world systems.

---

## ✅ Completed Implementations

The following **4 ML lab programs** have been successfully implemented as **end-to-end applications**:

### 1️⃣ Loan Amount Prediction using Linear Regression and Visualization
- Trained a Linear Regression model to predict loan amount based on applicant income
- Visualized data points and regression line
- Persisted the trained model using `joblib`
- Deployed the model via Flask REST API
- Integrated with a frontend UI for real-time prediction

### 2️⃣ Salary Prediction using Linear Regression
- Used a realistic salary dataset (Years of Experience vs Salary)
- Trained and evaluated a Linear Regression model
- Applied input validation based on training data range
- Exposed predictions through Flask API
- Connected frontend UI using Fetch API

### 3️⃣ Handwritten Character Recognition using Neural Networks
- Implemented a Neural Network-based character recognition system
- Performed image preprocessing and inference
- Designed a service layer for prediction logic
- Exposed character prediction through backend API

### 4️⃣ Digit Recognition using Neural Networks
- Built a digit recognition system using a trained neural network
- Implemented image upload handling in Flask
- Performed real-time digit prediction from uploaded images
- Achieved end-to-end flow from frontend to model inference
